Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is a preliminary step of Machine Learning and is used extensively in this field. Although it is not necessary to perform EDA to build models, but it is definitely recommended as it helps to know the data better. If performed correctly, it gives us insights which are not easy to witness directly.

In this notebook, I have performed a detailed analysis on Sachin & Virat ODI Runs. This notebook can be used as a manual to perform basic to intermediate EDA on any dataset. Following are the things that you will learn from this project :-

1. Knowing basic composition of data
2. Removing duplicates
3. Cleaning & Processing the Data
4. Understanding features
5. Comparing both data with Line chart
6. Creating linear regression.
7. Drawing insights and conclusions from data
